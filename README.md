# Solace PHP MQTT Samples

## About

PHP samples to access [Solace](www.solace.com) with Mosquitto MQTT API.

**Solace**: [Solace PubSub+ Platform](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-PubSub-Platform.htm) is a complete event streaming and management platform for real-time enterprises. PubSub+ helps enterprises design, deploy and manage event-driven architectures across hybrid cloud, multi-cloud and IoT environments.

PubSub+ event brokers power the **Event Mesh**, a modern messaging layer that can be deployed across every environment (Cloud, Software, Appliance) and component of the distributed enterprise to stream events across. PubSub+ APIs provide support for open protocols and APIs (MQTT, AMQP, JMS, REST) as well as proprietary messaging APIs. Solace APIs are available for several laugnages including Java, C, C++, JavaScript, .NET. More laguanges are being added and as of Oct 2020, PHP API is not supported in Solace.

**MQTT**: [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) is an OASIS standard lightweight messsging protocol. MQTT is supported in Solace event brokers.

**Mosquitto**: [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is an open source MQTT message broker and provides a C library for implementing MQTT clients.

**Mosquitto-PHP**: [Mosquitto-PHP](https://github.com/mgdm/Mosquitto-PHP) is an extension for using the  Mosquittoâ„¢ MQTT client library with PHP.
